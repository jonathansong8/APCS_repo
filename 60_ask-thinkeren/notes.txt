HW60 -- A Termite is-a Turtle, a Thinker is-a Turtle
2022-02-07
time spent: 0.5 hr

DISCO:
- as sentient thinkers, we are able to sort cards, but as turtles, the task is too complicated to relegate to just a few thinkeren.

QCC:
- how difficult would it be to deal with list remnants? (i.e. if one list is exhausted during merge while the other still has elements left)

THINKER FIRMWARE:
- Upon receiving a deck of cards, is the quantity one?
- If yes, return the deck to the thinker/turtle who gave you the deck.
- If not, split the deck into two and hand the two decks to 2 free thinkeren;
- Upon receiving the decks back, merge them together in ascending order and hand it back to the thinker who gave you the deck.
