Types of Errors:
 - Complie time error: indicates that there is something wrong with the syntax of the program
 - Run-time error: produced when something goes wrong while program is running
 - Logical error: causes the program to do something not meant to be done
 
 Fixing Compile-time Errors:
 - Look at first error listed
 - Number of error messages doesn't equal the number of errors
 - Check for common errors
 
 Fixing Run-time Errors:
 - Make sure your program isn't stuck in an infinite loop
 - If there is an infinte recursion, check if method has a base case
 - Don't overload with print statements
 
 Fixing Logic Erors
 - Check if something that is supposed to happen doesn't happen
 - Breack the program down into components
 - Program simplicity is key
 
 Tips to Follow for Clean Code:
 - Check if parentheses and brackets are in order
 - Indent to make it easier finding errors
 - Print out variables correctly
 - Use a visualizer to make your the output is correct
 - SEMICOLONS ARE IMPORTANT
 - Make sure to have correct return type
 - Use dot notation when invoking static methods
