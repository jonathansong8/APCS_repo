0) The "base" in "base-X number system" represents how many digits/symbols are
in the number system. As in base-10, our typical number system, all number
systems loop over when they reach their base number, and increment the value
of the previous number. For example, base-5 would only use the digits 0, 1,
2, 3, and 4, and when you are counting in base-5, you would count: 0, 1, 2,
3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 23 ... incrementing the next digit
whenever the a digit should reach 5.

1) Binary is a term for base-2, which is a number system that uses two digits.
It is commonly used in computing to represent information, because computers
can easily distinguish between on and off states. For example, 19 in binary is
10011, which is equivalent to (1 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) +
(1 * 2^0) = 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 19.

2) Start with the rightmost digit of the binary sequence. Set the variable
"index" to 0. Set the variable "total" to 0.

Repeat the following going leftward from and including this digit, until (and
including) the leftmost digit.

 0. Calculate the product of the current digit and 2^index
 1. Add previously calculated product to total.
 2. Increase "index" by 1.

Return the value of "total".

3) total = 175
   binary = ''

   while total > 1:
       r = total % 2
       binary += str(r)
       total -= r
       total //= r

   print('1' + binary[::-1])
