errata:

* hashmap is java equivalent to the python dictionaries you know and love
* nothing else should seem too unfamiliar to a Thinker

DISCO:
  0. Hashmaps are not as hard as they seem to be.
  1. We used the bottom helper methods to add punctuation and replace adjectives in the lab.
  2. We made a Splice method to convert the string into an ArrayList that could be used in a for loop.
  3. The while loop in Activity 5 was much harder to write than the for loop.

QCC:
  0. When should you use nested conditional statements and when should you use multiple boolean expressions?
